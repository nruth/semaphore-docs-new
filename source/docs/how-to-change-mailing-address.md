### For organizations:

After you click on your profile photo, from the drop-down menu choose the organization you'd like to update the mailing address for. On the left side of your organization page open "Subscription" > "Update payment method". You’ll be redirected to the Semaphore CI Store where you’ll be able to see the subscription details. Afterwards, click on "Edit subscription" > "Update address".

### For user accounts:

Click on your profile photo in the top right corner. Then open “Subscriptions” > “Change billing information” > "Edit Subscription" > “Update address”.

__Note:__
Email address used for the confirmation after changing the mailing address should be the one associated with billing.

If you want to change recipient name, billing email address or country, please
contact us at <mailto:support@semaphoreci.com>.
